# TAKY CANONICAL RUNTIME STATE

Status: ACTIVE / CANONICAL STATE SURFACE
Authority: subordinate to `MASTER/MASTER_LOGIC.md`; authoritative for current operational situation/decisions/open issues when consistent with higher canonical rules.

## Boot rule
A new conversation/session SHALL NOT reconstruct current TAKY/project state from conversational memory, a user-written summary, or a handoff summary first.

Required first recovery sequence:
`READ STATE.md -> VERIFY state_revision/source refs -> READ required canonical/history refs -> VERIFY resume evidence -> CONTINUE`.

If `STATE.md` cannot be read, current state is `STATE_REHYDRATION_BLOCKED`; do not assume remembered state is current.

## Current governance state
- repository enforcement: `REPOSITORY_EXECUTABLE + CI_ENFORCED`
- role/action/owner classification trust source: `UNVERIFIED`
- hosted ChatGPT native tool-call automatic preflight: `UNVERIFIED`
- live hosted runtime fail-closed claim: `PROHIBITED`
- P0 open architecture issue: `#2 Trusted routing authority + runtime preflight interception`

## Current unresolved root issues
1. Trusted routing authority independent from executor is not implemented.
2. Hosted ChatGPT native tool dispatch does not have a repository-proven mandatory preflight interception hook.
3. Validation-only evidence must not be allowed to advance authoritative product-progress state without functional acceptance evidence.
4. Resume/context-compression must use verified canonical/history rehydration evidence rather than self-reported booleans.

## State mutation rule
Material state changes SHALL update this file or a referenced canonical state owner in the same work episode.
Conversation text alone is not durable state.

Each session/conversation SHALL append only its material delta to `HISTORY/SESSION_DELTA_LOG.md` rather than regenerating a synthetic full-history summary.

## Resume gate
`resume_simulation_passed` SHALL NOT be accepted as a naked boolean.
A valid resume claim requires machine-verifiable resume evidence identifying at minimum:
- state source path;
- exact state SHA-256 or immutable revision;
- state read/verification timestamp or execution record;
- required canonical/history sources recovered;
- reconstruction assertions;
- evidence file SHA-256.

No resume evidence -> no verified resume.

## Claim boundary
`STATE FILE EXISTS != STATE READ`
`STATE READ != REQUIRED SOURCES VERIFIED`
`MANIFEST says PASS != RESUME VERIFIED`
`HANDOFF SUMMARY != CURRENT STATE`
